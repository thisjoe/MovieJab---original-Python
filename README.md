UPDATE: I am currently rewriting the app in JavaScript with the intention of developing it as a progressive web app. This version of the app will likely no longer be developed. A link to the new version of the app will be posted in this ReadMe when it is pushed.

A movie cataloging app, written in Python for use in console. App is actively being developed.

For now, the app is solely for use in console. GUI is on the roadmap for sometime in the future.
